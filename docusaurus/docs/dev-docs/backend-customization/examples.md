# Backend customization: An examples collection with FoodAdvisor

The present documentation is intended to developers who would like to get a deeper understanding of the Strapi back end customization possibilities. The page is a collection of examples that demonstrate how the core components of the back-end server of Strapi can be used in a real-world project, and how a front-end website can interact with the back end of Strapi.

Examples are meant to extend the features of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor), the official Strapi demo application. FoodAdvisor builds a ready-made restaurants directory powered by a Strapi back end (included in the `/api` folder) and renders a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-powered front-end website (included in the `/client` folder).

- builds a ready-made restaurants directory powered by a Strapi back end (included in the `/api` folder)
- and renders a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-powered front-end website (included in the `/client` folder).

This page can be read from start to finish, or you might want to jump directly to a specific section to understand how a given core element from the Strapi back end can be used to solve a real-world use case example.

:::prerequisites
- ðŸ‘€ You have read the [Quick Start Guide](/dev-docs/quick-start) and/or understood that Strapi is a **headless CMS** <Annotation>A headless CMS is a Content Management System that separates the presentation layer (i.e., the front end, where content is displayed) from the back end (where content is managed).<br /><br/>Strapi is a headless CMS that provides:<ul><li>a back-end server exposing an API for your content,</li><li>and a graphical user interface, called the admin panel, to manage the content.</li></ul>The presentation layer should be handled by another framework.</Annotation> that helps you create a data structure with the [Content-Type Builder](/user-docs/content-type-builder) and add some content through the [Content Manager](/user-docs/content-manager), then exposes the content through APIs.
- ðŸ‘€ You have read the [back-end customization introduction](/dev-docs/backend-customization) to get a general understanding of what routes, policies, middlewares, controllers, and services are in Strapi.
- ðŸ‘· If you want to test and play with the code examples by yourself, ensure you have cloned the [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) repository, setup the project, and started both the front-end and back-end servers. The Strapi admin panel should be accessible from [`localhost:1337/admin`](http://localhost:1337/admin) and the Next.js-based FoodAdvisor front-end website should be running on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
:::

## Authentication flow with JWT

Out of the box, the front-end website of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) does not provide any log in functionality. Logging in is done by accessing Strapi's admin panel at [`localhost:1337/admin`](http://localhost:1337/admin`).

<SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideColumn>

Let's add a basic login page to the front-end, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-powered website included in the `/client` folder of FoodAdvisor. The login page will be accessible at [`localhost:3000/auth/login`](http://localhost:3000/auth/login) and contain a typical email/password login form. This will allow programmatically authenticating API requests sent to Strapi.

Our goal is to create a front-end component to:

1. create a Next.js-powered front-end component to show a login form,
2. send a request to the `/auth/local` route of the Strapi back-end server to authenticate,
3. get a [JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) (JWT),
4. and store the JWT into the [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) property of your browser for later retrieval and authentication of our requests.

To achieve this, in the `/client` folder of the FoodAdvisor project, you could create a `pages/auth/login.js` file that contains the following example code:

## Services and Controllers: Writing a review

From the front-end website of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor), you can browse a list of restaurants accessible at [`localhost:3000/restaurants`](http://localhost:3000/restaurants). Clicking on any restaurant from the list will use the code included in the `/client` folder to display additional information about this restaurant. The content displayed on a restaurant page was created within Strapi's Content Manager and is retrieved by querying Strapi's REST API which uses code included in the `/api` folder.

In this section we will customize both:

- the front-end website to add a form allowing website visitors to write a review,
- and the back-end server of Strapi to perform actions whenever a review is created.

### REST API queries from the front end

<SideBySideContainer>
<SideBySideColumn>

Restaurant pages on the front-end website of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) include a Reviews section that is read-only. Adding reviews requires logging in to Strapi's admin panel and adding content to the "Reviews" collection type through the [Content Manager](/user-docs/content-manager).

Let's add a small front-end component to restaurant pages. This component will allow a user to write a review directly from the front-end website.

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

![Writing a review on the front end](/img/assets/backend-customization/tutorial-write-review.png)

</SideBySideColumn>

</SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideContainer>
<SideBySideColumn>

Our goal is to:

* add a form to write a review,
* display the form on any restaurants page,
* send a POST request to Strapi's REST API when the form is submitted,
* and use the [previously stored JWT](#authentication-flow-with-jwt) to authenticate the request.

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

:::strapi Related concept: REST API
The front-end code presented in this section uses [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to reach a content type endpoint on the back-end server of Strapi.

Additional information on endpoints for content types can be found in the [REST API](/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints) documentation.
:::

</SideBySideColumn>

</SideBySideContainer>

To achieve this, in the `/client` folder of the FoodAdvisor project, you could use the following code examples to:
- create a new `pages/restaurant/RestaurantContent/Reviews/new-review.js` file,
- and update the existing `components/pages/restaurant/RestaurantContent/Reviews/reviews.js`.

<details>
<summary>Example front-end code to add a component for writing reviews and display it on restaurants pages:</summary>

1. Create a new file in the `/client` folder to add a new component for writing reviews with the following code:

  ```jsx title='/client/components/pages/restaurant/RestaurantContent/Reviews/new-review.js'

  import { Button, Input, Textarea } from '@nextui-org/react';
  // highlight-start
  /** 
   * The form uses the Formik library (https://formik.org/).
   * Formik should be added to your project's dependencies;
   * Use yarn or npm to install it and it will be added to your package.json file.
   */
  import { useFormik } from 'formik';
  // highlight-end
  import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
  import React from 'react';
  import { getStrapiURL } from '../../../../../utils';

  const NewReview = () => {
    const router = useRouter();

    const { handleSubmit, handleChange, values } = useFormik({
      initialValues: {
        note: '',
        content: '',
      },
      onSubmit: async (values) => {
        /**
         * Queries Strapi REST API to reach the reviews endpoint
         * using the JWT previously stored in localStorage to authenticate
         */
        const res = await fetch(getStrapiURL('/reviews'), {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({
            restaurant: router.query.slug,
            ...values,
          }),
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
        });
      },
    });
    /**
     * Renders the form
     */
    return (
      <div className="my-6">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">Write your review</h1>
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
          <Input
            onChange={handleChange}
            name="note"
            type="number"
            min={1}
            max={5}
            label="Stars"
          />
          <Textarea
            name="content"
            onChange={handleChange}
            placeholder="What do you think about this restaurant?"
          />
          <Button
            type="submit"
            className="bg-primary text-white rounded-md self-start"
          >
            Send
          </Button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  };

  export default NewReview;
  ```

2. Display the new form component on any restaurants page by adding the highlighted lines (7, 8, and 13) to the code used to render restaurant's information:

  ```jsx title='/client/components/pages/restaurant/RestaurantContent/Reviews/reviews.js' showLineNumbers
  import React from 'react';
  import delve from 'dlv';

  import { formatDistance } from 'date-fns';

  import { getStrapiMedia } from '../../../../../utils';
  // highlight-start
  import { Textarea } from '@nextui-org/react';
  import NewReview from './new-review';
  // highlight-end

  const Reviews = ({ reviews }) => {
    return (
      <div className="col-start-2 col-end-2 mt-24">
        // highlight-next-line
        <NewReview />
        {reviews &&
          reviews.map((review, index) => (
    // â€¦
  ```

</details>

### Controllers vs. Services

Controllers could contain any business logic to be executed when the client requests a route. To illustrate the use of services, in this documentation the custom controller does not handle any responsibilities and delegate all the business logic to services.

Let's say we would like to customize the back end of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) to achieve the following scenario: when submitting the [previously added review form](#rest-api-queries-from-the-front-end) on the front-end website, Strapi will create a review in the back end and notify the restaurant owner by email. Translating this to Strapi back end customization means performing 3 actions:

1. Creating a custom service to [create the review](#custom-service-creating-a-review).
2. Creating a custom service to [send an email](#custom-service-sending-an-email-to-the-restaurant-owner).
3. [Customizing the default controller](#custom-controller) provided by Strapi for the Review content-type to use the 2 new services.

### Custom service: Creating a review

By default, service files in Strapi includes basic boilerplate code that use the `createCoreService` factory function.

Let's update the existing `review.js` service file for the "Reviews" collection type of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) by replacing its code to create a review.

<SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideColumn>

Our goal is to:

- declare a `create` method,
- grab [context](/dev-docs/backend-customization/requests-responses) from the request,
- use the `findMany()` method from the [EntityService API](/dev-docs/api/entity-service) to find a restaurant,
- use the `create()` method from the EntityService API to append data to the restaurant, [populating](/dev-docs/api/entity-service/populate) the restaurant owner,
- and return the new review data.
    
</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

:::strapi Related concepts: Services, EntityService API
The code presented in this section uses one of the possible ways to create a service. The code also illustrates the use of the Entity Service API to query content directly from the back-end server.

Additional information can be found in the [Services](/dev-docs/backend-customization/services) and [EntityService API](/dev-docs/api/entity-service) documentation.
:::

</SideBySideColumn>

</SideBySideContainer>

To create such a service, in the `/api` folder of the FoodAdvisor project, replace the content of the `src/api/review/services/review.js` file with the following code:

```jsx title="src/api/review/services/review.js"
const { createCoreService } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

module.exports = createCoreService('api::review.review', ({ strapi }) => ({
  async create(ctx) {
    const user = ctx.state.user;
    const { body } = ctx.request;

    /**
     * Queries the Restaurants collection type
     * using the Entity Service API
     * to retrieve information about the restaurant.
     */
    const restaurants = await strapi.entityService.findMany(
      'api::restaurant.restaurant',
      {
        filters: {
          slug: body.restaurant,
        },
      }
    );

    /**
     * Creates a new entry for the Reviews collection type
     * and populates data with information about the restaurant's owner
     * using the Entity Service API.
     */
    const newReview = await strapi.entityService.create('api::review.review', {
      data: {
        note: body.note,
        content: body.content,
        restaurant: restaurants[0].id,
        author: user.id,
      },
      populate: ['restaurant.owner'],
    });

    return newReview;
  },
}));
```

:::tip Tips
- In a controller's code, the `create` method from this service can be called with `strapi.service('api::review.review').create(ctx)` where `ctx` is the request's [context](/dev-docs/backend-customization/requests-responses).
- The provided example code does not cover error handling. You should consider handling errors, for instance when the restaurant does not exist. Additional information can be found in the [Error handling](/dev-docs/error-handling) documentation.
:::

### Custom Service: Sending an email to the restaurant owner

Out of the box, [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) does not provide any automated email service feature.

Let's create an `email.js` service file to send an email. We could use it in a [custom controller](#custom-controller) to notify the restaurant owner whenever a new review is created on the front-end website.

:::callout ðŸ¤— Optional service
This service is an advanced code example using the [Email](/dev-docs/plugins/email) plugin and requires understanding how [plugins](/dev-docs/plugins) and [providers](/dev-docs/providers) work with Strapi. If you don't need an email service to notify the restaurant's owner, you can skip this part and jump next to the custom [controller](#custom-controller) example.
:::

<SideBySideContainer>
<SideBySideColumn>

:::prerequisites
- You have setup a [provider for the Email plugin](/dev-docs/plugins/email), for instance the [Sendmail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strapi/provider-email-sendmail) provider.
- In Strapi's admin panel, you have [created an `Email` single type](/user-docs/content-type-builder/creating-new-content-type#creating-a-new-content-type) that contains a `from` Text field to define the sender email address.

<SideBySideColumn >

Our goal is to:
- create a new service file for the "Email" single type,
- declare a `send()` method for this service,
- grab the sender address stored in the Email single type using the [Entity Service API](/dev-docs/api/entity-service),
- use email details (recipient's address, subject, and email body) passed when invoking the service's `send()` method to send an email using the [Email plugin](/dev-docs/plugins/email) and a previously configured [provider](/dev-docs/providers).

  const { createCoreService } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

  module.exports = createCoreService('api::email.email', ({ strapi }) => ({
    async send({ to, subject, html }) {
      /**
       * Retrieves email configuration data
       * stored in the Email single type
       * using the Entity Service API.
       */
      const emailConfig = await strapi.entityService.findOne(
        'api::email.email',
        1
      );

      /**
       * Sends an email using:
       * - parameters to pass when invoking the service
       * - the 'from' address previously retrieved with the email configuration
       */
      await strapi.plugins['email'].services.email.send({
        to,
        subject,
        html,
        from: emailConfig.from,
      });
    },
  }));
  ```

:::tip
In a controller's code, the `send` method from this email service can be called with `strapi.service('api::email.email).send(parameters)` where `parameters` is an object with the email's related information (recipient's address, subject, and email body).
:::

### Custom controller

By default, controllers files in Strapi includes basic boilerplate code that use the `createCoreController` factory function. This exposes basic methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete content when reaching the requested endpoint. The default code for the controllers can be customized to perform any business logic.

Let's customize the default controller for the "Reviews" collection type of [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) with the following scenario: upon a `POST` request to the `/reviews` endpoint, the controller calls previously created services to both [create a review](#custom-service-creating-a-review) and [send an email](#custom-service-sending-an-email-to-the-restaurant-owner) to the restaurant's owner.

<SideBySideContainer>
<SideBySideColumn>

Our goal is to:

- extend the existing controller for the "Reviews" collection type,
- declare a custom `create()` method,
- call the 2 previously created services,
- and sanitize the content to be returned.

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

:::strapi Related concept: Controllers
The code presented in this section uses one of the possible ways to customize a controller.

Additional information can be found in the [Controllers](/dev-docs/backend-customization/controllers) documentation.
:::

</SideBySideColumn>

</SideBySideContainer>

To achieve this, in the `/api` folder of the FoodAdvisor project, replace the content of the `src/api/review/controllers/review.js` file with the following code:

```jsx title="src/api/review/controllers/review.js"

const { createCoreController } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

module.exports = createCoreController('api::review.review', ({ strapi }) => ({
  async create(ctx) {
    // Creates the new review using a service
    const newReview = await strapi.service('api::review.review').create(ctx);

    // Sends an email to the restaurant's owner, using another service
    if (newReview.restaurant?.owner) {
      await strapi.service('api::email.email').send({
        to: newReview.restaurant.owner.email,
        subject: 'You have a new review!',
        html: `You've received a ${newReview.note} star review: ${newReview.content}`,
      });
    }

    const sanitizedReview = await this.sanitizeOutput(newReview, ctx);

    ctx.body = sanitizedReview;
  },
}));
```

## Policies

Out of the box, [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) does not use any custom policies or route middlewares that could control access to content type endpoints.

Let's say we would like to customize the backend of FoodAdvisor to prevent restaurant owners from creating fake reviews for their businesses. In Strapi, controlling access to an endpoint can be done either with a policy or route middleware. Policies are read-only and can only allow a request to pass or return an error, while route middlewares can perform additional business logic. In our example, let's use a policy.

<SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideColumn>

Our goal is to:
1. Create a new folder for policies to apply only to the "Reviews" collection type,
2. Create a new policy file,
3. Use the `findMany()` method from the [Entity Service API](/dev-docs/api/entity-service) to get information about the owner of a restaurant when the `/reviews` endpoint is reached,
4. Return an error if the authenticated user is the restaurant's owner, or let the request pass in other cases.

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

:::strapi Related concept: Policies, Route Middlewares
The code presented in this section uses a custom policy to control access to an endpoint's resources. Route middlewares can also be used.

const { errors } = require('@strapi/utils');
const { PolicyError } = errors;

module.exports = async (policyContext, config, { strapi }) => {
  const { body } = policyContext.request;
  const { user } = policyContext.state;

  // Return an error if there is no authenticated user with the request
  if (!user) {
    return false;
  }
  /**

  const filteredRestaurants = await strapi.entityService.findMany(
    'api::restaurant.restaurant',
    {
      filters: {
        slug: body.restaurant,
      },
      populate: ['owner'],
    }
  );

  const restaurant = filteredRestaurants[0];

  if (!restaurant) {
    return false;
  }

  /**
   * If the user submitting the request is the restaurant's owner,
   * we don't allow the review creation.
   */ 
  if (user.id === restaurant.owner.id) {

:::caution
Policies or route middlewares should be configured in the configuration of a route to actually control access. This is covered in the [routes](#routes) section of this documentation.
:::

## Routes

Out of the box, [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) does not use control acceess to its endpoints. 

Let's say we previsouly created a policy to restrict access to the "Reviews" content-type to some conditions, for instance to prevent a restaurant's owner to create a review for their restaurants. The policy should now be enabled on the route we use to create reviews.

<SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideColumn>

Our goal is to:

- explicitly define a routes configuration for the "Reviews" content-type
- append the [previously defined custom policy](#policies) to the route

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

:::strapi Related concept: Routes
The code presented in this section adds a custom policy to a route.

Additional information can be found in the [Policies](/dev-docs/backend-customization/policies) and [Routes](/dev-docs/backend-customization/routes) documentation.
:::

</SideBySideColumn>

</SideBySideContainer>

To achieve this, in the `/api` folder of the FoodAdvisor project, replace the content of the `api/src/api/review/routes/review.js` file with the following code:

```jsx title="src/api/review/routes/review.js"

'use strict';

const { createCoreRouter } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

module.exports = createCoreRouter('api::review.review', {
  config: {
    create: {
      auth: false,
      policies: ['is-owner-review'],
      middlewares: [],
    },
  },
});
```
<!--

_Content below these lines will be reworked soon._

### Default Policy Error

```jsx
{
    "data": null,
    "error": {
        "status": 403,
        "name": "PolicyError",
        "message": "Policy Failed",
        "details": {}
    }
}
```

### Custom Policy Error

```jsx
{
    "data": null,
    "error": {
        "status": 403,
        "name": "PolicyError",
        "message": "The owner of the restaurant cannot submit reviews",
        "details": {
            "policy": "is-owner-review",
            "errCode": "RESTAURANT_OWNER_REVIEW"
        }
    }
}
```

</aside>

Now, we can easily catch the error from the frontend and display it with a [Toast Notification](https://github.com/timolins/react-hot-toast). 

![Restaurant owner can't submit reviews](/img/assets/backend-customization/tutorial-owner-cantsubmit.png)

![Write review success](/img/assets/backend-customization/tutorial-write-review-success.png)

```jsx
// Errors 
class UnauthorizedError extends Error {
	// You can use a custom error implementation to be able to distinguish it better
	// from other types of errors
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
  }
}

// components/pages/restaurant/RestaurantContent/Reviews/new-review.js
[...]
try{
	[...]
	const { error } = await res.json();
	if (error) {
	  throw new UnauthorizedError(error.message);
	}
	toast.success('Review created!');
}catch(err){
	toast.error(err.message)
}
[...]
```

### Middleware

Now that weâ€™ve seen the power of policies for access control, you might be wondering what you can use middlewares for, and even though you could use them for the same as policies, they have more appropriate use cases. In essence, a middlware is something that gets executed in between a request arriving at the server and the controller function getting executed. So, for instance, itâ€™s a good place to post our analytics. Letâ€™s create a rudimentary example of an analytics dashboard made with Google Spreadsheets to have some insights on which restaurants are more visited. Every time we have an incoming request to `/restaurants/:id` we need to run the analytics middleware and update our spreadsheet. First, letâ€™s build some functions that will help us interact with our Spreadsheet, to get more details about it [refer to its documentation](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values?hl=es-419).

```jsx
// src/api/restaurant/middlewares/utils.js

const { google } = require('googleapis');

const createGoogleSheetClient = async ({
  keyFile,
  sheetId,
  tabName,
  range,
}) => {
  async function getGoogleSheetClient() {
    const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
      keyFile,
      scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets'],
    });
    const authClient = await auth.getClient();
    return google.sheets({
      version: 'v4',
      auth: authClient,
    });
  }

  const googleSheetClient = await getGoogleSheetClient();

  const writeGoogleSheet = async (data) => {
    googleSheetClient.spreadsheets.values.append({
      spreadsheetId: sheetId,
      range: `${tabName}!${range}`,
      valueInputOption: 'USER_ENTERED',
      insertDataOption: 'INSERT_ROWS',
      resource: {
        majorDimension: 'ROWS',
        values: data,
      },
    });
  };

  const updateoogleSheet = async (cell, data) => {
    googleSheetClient.spreadsheets.values.update({
      spreadsheetId: sheetId,
      range: `${tabName}!${cell}`,
      valueInputOption: 'USER_ENTERED',
      resource: {
        majorDimension: 'ROWS',
        values: data,
      },
    });
  };

  const readGoogleSheet = async () => {
    const res = await googleSheetClient.spreadsheets.values.get({
      spreadsheetId: sheetId,
      range: `${tabName}!${range}`,
    });

    return res.data.values;
  };

  return {
    writeGoogleSheet,
    updateoogleSheet,
    readGoogleSheet,
  };
};

module.exports = {
  createGoogleSheetClient,
};
```

Basically, the code above will let us **read, write and update a Google spreadsheet** given an API Key read from a JSON file and a spreadsheet ID retrieved from the URL:

![Google Spreadsheet URL](/img/assets/backend-customization/tutorial-spreadsheet-url.png)

Now we can create the Middleware function in a file named `analytics.` inside the `middlewares` folder.

```jsx
// src/api/restaurant/middlewares/analytics.js

'use strict';

const { createGoogleSheetClient } = require('./utils');

const serviceAccountKeyFile = './gs-keys.json';
const sheetId = '1P7Oeh84c18NlHp1Zy-5kXD8zgpoA1WmvYL62T4GWpfk';
const tabName = 'Restaurants';
const range = 'A2:C';

const VIEWS_CELL = 'C';

const transformGSheetToObject = (response) =>
  response.reduce(
    (acc, restaurant) => ({
      ...acc,
      [restaurant[0]]: {
        id: restaurant[0],
        name: restaurant[1],
        views: restaurant[2],
        cellNum: Object.keys(acc).length + 2 // + 2 because we need to consider the header and that the initial length is 0, so our first real row would be 2,
      },
    }),
    {}
  );

module.exports = (config, { strapi }) => {
  return async (context, next) => {
    console.log('Coming to the middleware');
    // Generating google sheet client
    const { readGoogleSheet, updateoogleSheet, writeGoogleSheet } =
      await createGoogleSheetClient({
        keyFile: serviceAccountKeyFile,
        range,
        sheetId,
        tabName,
      });
		
		// Get the restaurant ID from the params in the URL
    const restaurantId = context.params.id;
    const restaurant = await strapi.entityService.findOne(
      'api::restaurant.restaurant',
      restaurantId
    );

		// Read the spreadsheet to get the current data
    const restaurantAnalytics = await readGoogleSheet();
		
		// The return data comes in the shape [1, "Mint Lounge", 23], and we need to transform it into an object: {id: 1, name: "Mint Lounge", views: 23, cellNum: 2}
    const requestedRestaurant =
      transformGSheetToObject(restaurantAnalytics)[restaurantId];

    if (requestedRestaurant) {
      await updateoogleSheet(
        `${VIEWS_CELL}${requestedRestaurant.cellNum}:${VIEWS_CELL}${requestedRestaurant.cellNum}`,
        [[Number(requestedRestaurant.views) + 1]]
      );
    } else {
			// If we don't have the restaurant in the spreadsheet already, we create it with 1 view, of course.
      const newRestaurant = [[restaurant.id, restaurant.name, 1]];
      await writeGoogleSheet(newRestaurant);
    }
	
		// Call next to continue with the flow and get to the controller
    next();
  };
};
```

![Google Spreadsheet data](/img/assets/backend-customization/tutorial-spreadsheet-data.png)

Now, as we did in the policies, we need to append the middleware to the route where we want it to get executed:

```jsx
// src/api/restaurant/routes/restaurant.js

'use strict';

const { createCoreRouter } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

module.exports = createCoreRouter('api::restaurant.restaurant', {
  config: {
    findOne: {
      auth: false,
      policies: [],
      middlewares: ['api::restaurant.analytics'],
    },
  },
});
```

This video shows how the middleware gets executed in every request, updating the spreadsheet and generating new data:
